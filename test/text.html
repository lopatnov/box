      Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young girl named Lily.
      She loved exploring the woods and discovering new places. One day, she
      found a hidden path that led to a magical garden filled with colorful
      flowers and sparkling streams. Lily spent hours playing in the garden,
      making friends with the animals and enjoying the beauty around her. As the
      sun began to set, she promised to return the next day to continue her
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Lily woke up early, eager to return to the magical
      garden. She packed a small bag with some snacks and set off on her
      journey. As she walked through the woods, she noticed the birds singing
      and the sun shining brightly. When she arrived at the hidden path, she
      felt a sense of excitement and wonder. She followed the path and soon
      found herself back in the enchanting garden. This time, she discovered a
      beautiful fountain in the center of the garden, with crystal-clear water
      flowing gently. Lily sat by the fountain, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere
      and feeling grateful for the magical place she had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went by, Lily visited the magical garden every day. She
      learned more about the plants and animals that lived there, and even
      discovered a hidden treehouse high up in the branches of an ancient oak
      tree. The treehouse became her secret hideaway, where she could watch the
      world below and dream about her future adventures. Lily knew that the
      garden was a special place, and she felt lucky to have found it. She
      promised to always take care of it and keep its magic alive for years to
      come.

      The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link
      from one page to another. The most important attribute of the
      <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is the <code>href</code> attribute, which
      indicates the link's destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <kbd>&lt;kbd&gt;</kbd> tag is used to define keyboard input. The
      content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <samp>&lt;samp&gt;</samp> tag is used to define sample output from a
      computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default
      monospace font.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <var>&lt;var&gt;</var> tag is used to define a variable in a computer
      program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default
      monospace font.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag defines preformatted text. The text
      inside a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element is displayed in a fixed-width
      font, and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      function fibonacci(n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
      }

      console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">&lt;abbr&gt;</abbr> tag is
      used to represent an abbreviation or acronym. When the user hovers over
      the abbreviation, the full description is displayed, providing additional
      context. This is particularly useful for technical terms or phrases that
      may not be immediately clear to all readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag is used in conjunction with the
      <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag to provide a summary or caption for the
      details that can be viewed or hidden by the user. For example:

      <details>
        <summary>More about the magical garden</summary>
        <p>
          The magical garden was not just an ordinary place. It had a unique
          charm that captivated anyone who visited. The flowers seemed to bloom
          in the most vibrant colors, and the streams sparkled like diamonds
          under the sunlight. The garden was a sanctuary for many animals, and
          they lived in harmony, creating a peaceful and serene environment.
        </p>
      </details>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> tag is used to define the contact
      information for the author or owner of a document or article. The content
      inside is typically displayed in italics and can include physical
      addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and URLs. For example:
